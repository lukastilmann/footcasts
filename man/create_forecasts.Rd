\title{Create Season Forecasts for Multiple Leagues and Years}
\usage{
create_forecasts(league_ids, years)
}
\arguments{
\item{league_ids}{Integer vector of league IDs to process}

\item{years}{Integer vector of years (season end years) to process}
}
\value{
NULL (invisible). Function called for side effects of creating forecast files.
}
\description{
Generates pre-season strength predictions and incremental forecasts for each
completed matchday across specified leagues and years. Saves all outputs to disk
and skips existing files to enable resumable batch processing.
}
\details{
For each league-year combination:
\itemize{
\item Creates or loads pre-season strength predictions
\item Identifies completed matchdays (where all fixtures are finished)
\item Generates incremental forecasts from matchday 0 (pre-season) through last completed matchday
\item Saves forecasts as RDS files using standardized file paths
}

Uses fixed simulation parameters: 1000 simulations, 0.05 update rate, xG weight of 1.
Creates necessary output directories automatically.
