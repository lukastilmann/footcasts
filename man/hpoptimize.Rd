\arguments{
\item{league_ids}{A vector of league identifiers to use for model evaluation.}

\item{years}{A vector of years to include in the evaluation.}

\item{param_bounds}{A named list where each element specifies the bounds
for a parameter. For continuous and integer parameters, provide a
numeric vector of length 2 with (min, max). For factor parameters,
provide a character vector of possible values.}

\item{param_types}{A named list specifying the type of each parameter.
Valid types are "continuous", "integer", or "factor". Names must
match those in param_bounds.}

\item{n_initial}{Number of initial random configurations. Default is 64.}

\item{initial_budget}{Initial number of simulations for each configuration.
Default is 100.}

\item{halving_proportion}{Proportion of configurations to keep in each
successive round. Default is 0.5.}

\item{n_rounds}{Number of halving rounds to perform. Default is 5.}

\item{gamma}{Quantile threshold for TPE good/bad split. Default is 0.25.}

\item{bw_factor}{Numeric value that is multiplied with KDE-bandwidths. Values
above 1 allow for more exploration of the space. Default is 1.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to print progress messages.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{parallel}{Logical indicating whether to use parallel processing
for model evaluation. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{configs}{Data frame of all evaluated configurations}
\item{scores}{Numeric vector of all scores}
\item{budgets}{Numeric vector of simulation budgets used for each evaluation}
\item{best_config}{Data frame with the best configuration found}
\item{best_score}{The best (lowest) score achieved}
\item{n_evaluations}{Total number of function evaluations}
}
\description{
Performs hyperparameter optimization using Tree Parzen Estimators (TPE)
as a surrogate model combined with successive halving for efficient
resource allocation. Optimizes hyperparameters for models evaluated
across specified leagues and years.
}
\details{
The function uses successive halving to efficiently allocate computational
resources. In each round, the budget (number of simulations) is doubled
while the number of configurations is halved. The TPE surrogate model
learns from all previous evaluations to propose promising new configurations.

The objective function calls \code{score_hyperparameters} internally with
the specified hyperparameters, number of simulations, years, league IDs,
and parallel setting.
