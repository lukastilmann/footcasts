\title{Rejection Sampling from TPE Good Distribution}
\usage{
rejection_sample_tpe(
  surrogate,
  n_samples_target,
  param_bounds,
  param_types,
  max_attempts = 10000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{surrogate}{A fitted TPE surrogate model object returned by
\code{\link{fit_tpe_surrogate}}.}

\item{n_samples_target}{Integer specifying the target number of samples
to generate.}

\item{param_bounds}{A named list of parameter bounds (see
\code{\link{generate_uniform_samples}}).}

\item{param_types}{A named list of parameter types (see
\code{\link{generate_uniform_samples}}).}

\item{max_attempts}{Maximum number of rejection sampling attempts.
Default is 10000.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the accepted samples. If fewer than
n_samples_target samples are accepted within max_attempts, a warning
is issued and the available samples are returned.
}
\description{
Performs rejection sampling to draw samples from the "good" distribution
of a fitted TPE surrogate model.
}
\details{
This function uses rejection sampling with a uniform proposal distribution.
The maximum density is estimated from a set of test points with a 20\%
buffer to improve acceptance rates.

# Assuming surrogate is already fitted
samples <- rejection_sample_tpe(
  surrogate,
  n_samples_target = 100,
